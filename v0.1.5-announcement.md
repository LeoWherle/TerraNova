# TerraNova v0.1.5 is out! 🚀

## What's New

🔗 **Node Interjection** — Drop nodes directly onto wires to splice them in. Animated hover previews, auto-spacing, and full undo support.

📐 **Angle Density Evaluator** — New node computing angles between positions and reference vectors, with bidirectional axis mirroring.

🎚️ **Manual Curve Sliders** — Interactive range sliders for curve point editing with unrestricted manual input override.

🧩 **FieldFunction Delimiters** — Full import/export and graph rendering support for FieldFunction MaterialProviders with delimiter ranges.

📌 **Manual Curve Static Bounds** — Bounds compute once on load instead of every edit, improving curve editor performance.

## Bug Fixes

- 3D Point nodes now display correctly instead of showing "Constant"
- RangeDouble fields are now editable in the property panel
- Angle density node has proper Vector input port
- Manual curves import correctly for PositionsCellNoise nodes
- Graph flow direction changes no longer break edge routing
- Hardware detection: accurate RAM cap, native GPU detection, corrected VRAM for RX 7700 XT/7600 & RTX 4060/4090
- Multiple density evaluator fixes (Anchor, CellWallDistance, YSampled, SwitchState, Shell, VectorWarp, GradientWarp)
